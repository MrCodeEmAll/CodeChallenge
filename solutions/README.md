# Speed Detector

## Description
This JavaScript program simulates a speed detector that checks if a car is exceeding the speed limit and assigns demerit points accordingly. If the driver has more than 12 demerit points, their license is suspended.

## How to Run
1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `node solution2.js` to see the output for different speed inputs.

## How it Works
- If the speed is less than 70, it prints `"Ok"`.
- For every 5 km/h above 70, it assigns 1 demerit point.
- If the driver has more than 12 demerit points, it prints `"License suspended"`.
